# Local Development

The local development stack contains only MESGuard dependencies:

- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector: diagnostic runs, events, knowledge metadata,
  evaluations, and long-term state.
- SQL Server 2022 Developer: synthetic MES data queried by future read-only
  diagnostic tools.
- Redis 7: short-lived state, locks, and cache. It is not the system of record.
- `backend`: the `cmd/mesguard-api` executable.

## Start

1. Copy [`../.env.compose.example`](../.env.compose.example) to `.env` if local values
   need to be overridden.
2. Start the stack:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

The one-shot `migrate` service applies pending Goose migrations before the API
starts. For a direct Go/GoLand run, start PostgreSQL and apply migrations first:

```powershell
go run ./cmd/mesguard-migrate status
go run ./cmd/mesguard-migrate up
go run ./cmd/mesguard-migrate check
```

3. Verify the API:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:9090/healthz
```

The current Web shell connects to PostgreSQL and Redis during startup so that
`/healthz` can verify both dependencies. The API checks the required database
version at startup but never applies migrations itself.

## Logging

Local configuration writes readable console logs and rotated JSON files under
`logs/`. Docker configuration writes JSON to stdout so the container runtime can
collect and rotate it. Every HTTP completion log includes `request_id`, method,
route, status, latency, response size, client IP, and error count.

## Repository and transactions

Business use cases depend on `internal/repository.TxManager` instead of GORM.
The PostgreSQL implementation is created with `postgres.NewTxManager(db)` and
passes the active transaction through `context.Context`:

```go
err := txManager.WithinTx(ctx, func(txCtx context.Context) error {
    // Every Repository call in this callback must receive txCtx.
    return userRepository.Save(txCtx, user)
})
```

PostgreSQL Repository adapters call `postgres.ResolveDB(ctx, db)` before each
query. Nested `WithinTx` calls join the existing transaction; they do not create
an independent commit or savepoint. Returning an error rolls the outer
transaction back, while returning `nil` commits it.

Transactions must contain database work only. SQL Server queries, MinIO,
RabbitMQ, Redis notifications, model calls, and other network operations run
before or after the transaction so database locks are not held during slow or
unreliable external calls.

Repository adapters translate framework-specific errors with
`postgres.TranslateError`. Use `errors.Is` with `repository.ErrNotFound` or
`repository.ErrConflict` in the application layer, then map them to the
appropriate application error code. Constraint-name-specific rules remain in
the owning Repository rather than in the generic translator.

Real transaction tests require an isolated or disposable PostgreSQL database:

```powershell
$env:MESGUARD_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN = "postgres://..."
go test ./internal/platform/postgres -run TestTxManagerAgainstPostgres -v
```

Stop the stack with `docker compose down`. Do not add `-v` unless the local
PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Redis data should be discarded deliberately.

## Volumes

Compose uses named volumes by default. To use host directories, set one or more
of these variables in `.env`:

```dotenv
MESGUARD_POSTGRES_DATA=D:/develop/docker_workspace/mesguard/postgres
MESGUARD_SQLSERVER_DATA=D:/develop/docker_workspace/mesguard/sqlserver
MESGUARD_REDIS_DATA=D:/develop/docker_workspace/mesguard/redis
```
