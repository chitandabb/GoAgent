# Local Development

The local development stack contains only MESGuard dependencies:

- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector: diagnostic runs, events, knowledge metadata,
  evaluations, and long-term state.
- SQL Server 2022 Developer: synthetic MES data queried by future read-only
  diagnostic tools.
- Redis 7: short-lived state, locks, and cache. It is not the system of record.
- `backend`: the `cmd/mesguard-api` executable.

## Start

1. Copy [`../.env.compose.example`](../.env.compose.example) to `.env` if local values
   need to be overridden.
2. Start the stack:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

3. Verify the API:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:9090/healthz
```

The current Web shell connects to PostgreSQL and Redis during startup so that
`/healthz` can verify both dependencies. It does not apply business migrations.

## Logging

Local configuration writes readable console logs and rotated JSON files under
`logs/`. Docker configuration writes JSON to stdout so the container runtime can
collect and rotate it. Every HTTP completion log includes `request_id`, method,
route, status, latency, response size, client IP, and error count.

Stop the stack with `docker compose down`. Do not add `-v` unless the local
PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Redis data should be discarded deliberately.

## Volumes

Compose uses named volumes by default. To use host directories, set one or more
of these variables in `.env`:

```dotenv
MESGUARD_POSTGRES_DATA=D:/develop/docker_workspace/mesguard/postgres
MESGUARD_SQLSERVER_DATA=D:/develop/docker_workspace/mesguard/sqlserver
MESGUARD_REDIS_DATA=D:/develop/docker_workspace/mesguard/redis
```
